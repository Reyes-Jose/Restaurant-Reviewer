# Restaurant Reviews 

## Add reviews for your favorite restaurants!

Everybody loves food and looking at reviews before going to restaurants is a huge part of foodie culture. Our app provides a brief list, introduction of restaurants, and review by users. 
It pulls information from (our RESTful API?) and provides reviews of users that have been to the restaurant before. Additionally, it contains a login page and profile page that allows users to create their own reviews in real time. The app has a feature to save the reviews to the profile page as well as the main page containing the restaurants. It also let users to remove previous reviews from the list. 

## User Story:

I want to access and write restaurant reviews based on the restaurant name. So that I can easily see if pets are allowed and if the environment and food of the restaurant are what I am looking for.

As a user, I want to add reviews with my experience of those restaurants. Those reviews are then saved in my profile page and I am able to access my previous reviews with the ability to delete them.

## Technologies used:

Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API. Handlebars.js as the template engine and display. MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database. Incorporation of GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data. Usage of Bulma for styling.
